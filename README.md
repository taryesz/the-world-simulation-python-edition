Welcome to The World Simulation!

This is one of my university projects that I decided to upload here to have some kinda portfolio.
If you want to play-test it, you're very welcome do download it.

The game starts with random generation of the map, specifically the animals and the player. The animals move in a pretty much chaotic way 
(except for Cyber Sheep, but you'll see more info below), though the player has full control with arrow keys. The goal is basically to 
survive and not get killed either by more powerful animals, or poisonous plants.

So, there are a couple types of animals available:

wolf (9)
fox (3)
sheep (4)
antelope (4)
turtle (2)
cyber sheep (11)

..as well as plants:

grass (0)
dandelion (0)
guarana (0)
hogweed (10)
nightshade (99)

..and a player themselves (5)

Those brakets show the power of each animal, so now you can understand who can kill whom. Except, beware that even if a weaker animal
eats guarana, its power will be increased by 3 and it can possibly kill you too!

The player can also activate a special ability by pressing space bar - it will allow you to make 5 moves being impossible to get killed.
If you collide with more powerful animal/plant, you will be randomly teleported to the nearest spot available.

Cyber Sheep chooses to move to the nearest hogweed plant, however, if there isn't one, it moves just like others.

Note: the animals can have babies, and plants can spread in some time.

All the in-game stuff happening is visible in a chat window, including coords of all animals, special ability durability, etc.
You can also save/load the game by clicking 's' and 'l'. Also, you can choose the map size before launching the game. 
By default it's 10x10

Oh, and btw, you can add more animals to the game by simply clicking with your mouse on a spot you want to spawn an animal/plant in.

I guess that's it, don't judge too hard cuz it's one of my very first projects :D

Thanks, 
Taras
